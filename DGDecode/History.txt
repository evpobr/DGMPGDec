Fixed a little bug with the info option, and added faster mmx conv
routines for 4:2:2 planar -> 4:2:2 packed and vice versa.

----------

This is a 1.0.13b4 version of dgdecode but with the following changes:

1.) added info option to mpeg2source() to display info on frames
      - example usage:  mpeg2source(info=true)

2.) iPP is a bool again.  If it is not explicitly set to true or false then it 
       defaults to auto which switches between field/frame based pp based on the 
       progressive_frame flag

3.) 4:2:2 input support
      - can now correctly decode 4:2:2 input sources and correctly output it
           to AviSynth as YUY2

      *NOTE:  mpeg2source() now throws an error on 4:4:4 input, it could handle it
               but AviSynth 2.5 does not have internal YUV 4:4:4 support

    3a.) 4:2:2 PLANAR post-processing support

4.) Upsampling to 4:2:2 from 4:2:0 based on progressive_frame flag.  Uses new
       upConv parameter of mpeg2source().

      - example   mpeg2source(upConv=true)

      *NOTES:  it will only work if input is 4:2:0, if input is anything else
                then the upConv parameter is ignored

5.) BlindPP now supports YUY2 colorspace

6.) other stuff:

      - fixed blindPP syntax bug  (x and X)
      - fixed a small bug with showQ option
      - fixed small memory leak with FrameList/GOPList not being free'd
      - fixed a bug in the vertical chroma deblocking postprocessing
              QP pointer being passed was incorrect for 4:2:0
      - faster mmx 4:2:2 to packed YUY2 and YUY2 to planar 4:2:2 conversions
      - info output would not work correctly if temporal_reference was not zero
        based at the beginning of gops, it does now

changes.doc (Sept 11, 2003)
--------------------------

Modified the decoding and random access code so that it never has
to skip B frames. This was the cause of the frame dropping problem.
This version must be used with an appropriately modified DVD2AVI
version, for example, DGIndex. If these two are used together,
frames will never be dropped. Refer to the DVD2AVI forum at doom9.org
for a discussion of this problem. Search for the thread "does dvd2avi
chop off frames?". Also fixes several bugs in MPEG2 decoding.

Note: This version is derived from Nic's MPEG2DEC3 1.10.

changes.doc (08 dec 2002)
-------------------------

here's the code of MPEG2Dec3
it's based on MPEG2Dec2, some parts of the code are intact, others heavily modified.
you'll need both nasm & masm to compile it.
it should compile flawlessly under M$ VC++ 6 SP4 (the compiler i use)
you can use the profiling define (commented out in global.h) to test optimisations.
BTW, if you don't have nasm, i added mcsse.obj to the sources.

-----------------

In addition to pcdvdguy's changes below this version also is optimized for P4/SSE2 code. This will be used whenever the machine supports it and "iDCT_Algorithm=5" is specified int the .d2v file. That can be put there with an editor or by using the newer version of DVD2AVI that also supports this. See the save-oe project on Sourceforge.

This version also has other minor optimizations and something of a fix for crashing on garbage data such as ATSC HDTV captures.

If cropping has been specified in DVD2AVI then it will now work, without messing up the color. If resizing was specified it will still be ignored, so you'll have to do that in your .Avisynth script or elsewhere.

-----------------
This document explains the changes made to the DVD2AVI/MPEG2DEC.DLL source-code, for the purpose of decoding MPEG-2 transport streams.

Special thanks to Ben Cooley, for writing HDTVtoMPEG2, a great source of inspiration!

MPEG-2 transport stream demuxing

	This feature allows MPEG2DEC.DLL to parse MPEG2 transport streams (*.trp, *.ts), and decode MPEG-1/2 video elementary streams.  It has been successfully tested with several ATSC/DTV broadcasters in the Southern California area.  The code to support this feature is still considered 'preliminary', and suffers from the following limitations:

1) When opened in DVD2AVI, the input-filename extension *.trp and *.ts are unconditionally treated as transport-streams.  Otherwise, other input-filenames are briefly checked (first 2048 bytes) for an MPEG-2 transport sync-byte sequence.  If this sequence is found, the entire stream is treated as an MPEG-2 transport stream.

2) There is currently *NO* GUI to select the video-ID and audio-ID.  These variables are stored in the DVD2AVI.ini file, and the user (that's YOU) must manually edit the ini file to set the video-ID and audio-ID.

2) If you want to use avisynth with DVD2AVI, you will need the updated MPEG2DEC.DLL.  The updated DLL has added support for transport-stream demuxing.  If you want to use DVD2AVI as a VFAPI frameserver, you will need the updated DVD2AVI.VFP (for the same reason.)

3) Do NOT mix MPEG-2 program streams (*.vob, *.mpg) and MPEG-2 transport streams (*.trp, *.ts) in the same d2v project-file!  

4) DVD2AVI is sensitive to bitstream errors.  Your broadcast DTV recordings may contain errors, which will manifest as distortion, image breakup, and other visual artifacts.  At worst, mpeg2dec.dll can crash.  Unfortunately, there is no way to guard against this except to routinely check your DTV-receiver's quality-monitor and adjust accordingly.

mpeg2dec.dll relies on the variable "SystemStream_Flag==2" to identify transport-streams.  (In the d2v-project file, the following line indicates the video_stream_id and audio_stream_id, but only the video_stream_id is used.)

5) The ATSC DTV standard allows many different formats. To work with the highest-resolution mode (1920x1080 30i), a fast CPU and lots of memory is recommended!

Source code-changes
----------------------------
SystemStream_Flag == 2 ; // MPEG-2 transport stream (calls to Next_Packet() are redirected to Next_Transport_Packet() )

global.h - add declaration for function "Next_Transport_Packet()"
  int MPEG2_Transport_VideoPID;  // VideoID for MPEG-2 transport streams
  int MPEG2_Transport_AudioPID;// AudioID for MPEG-2 transport streams

getbit.c - add function Next_Transport_Packet(), this does the bulk of the work!

gui.cpp - initializes the variables (MPEG2_Transport_VideoPID, MPEG2_Transport_AudioPID), first by reading from dvd2avi.ini, and then by re-reading those values from the D2V project file (if one is opened, and the SystemStream_Flag==2.)  Also modify the 'open' dialog-box, to add an entry for file-filter ("*.trp, *.ts")

mpeg2dec.c - scans the first 2048 bytes of the MPEG-bitstream (to check if it's an MPEG-2 transport-stream.)
